# Hotel Data Analysis
In today's data-driven world, businesses seek to harness the power of data to make informed decisions and optimize their operations. This project embarks on a journey to explore a rich dataset spanning three years (2018, 2019, and 2020) from a hotel's revenue records. Leveraging the capabilities of SQL and Power BI, we delve into this dataset to unearth valuable insights related to revenue and guest seasonality.

# Data Ingestion and Preparation

Our journey begins with the ingestion of raw data from a .csv file into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This step ensures that the data is accessible and ready for analysis. Once the data is in SSMS, we embark on the iterative process of building SQL queries, allowing us to refine and shape the dataset to suit our analytical needs. These SQL queries form the foundation for our subsequent analysis.

# Data Analysis with SQL

SQL is a versatile tool for data manipulation and retrieval. With SQL, we filter, group, and aggregate the data to answer key questions about the hotel's revenue trends. By querying the data, we gain deeper insights into guest behavior and revenue patterns, enabling us to make data-driven recommendations for the hotel's staffing arrangement.

# Power BI Visualization

Data analysis is only part of the journey; communicating the insights effectively is equally important. Here, Power BI comes into play. Power BI empowers us to create stunning and interactive data visualizations. We harness PowerQuery M within Power BI for additional data processing, enabling us to craft compelling visual narratives that bring our findings to life. Through visually engaging charts and graphs, we make complex data comprehensible and actionable.

# Summary
This project combines the power of SQL and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. By exploring the hotel's revenue data, we aim to empower businesses to make informed decisions, optimize their operations, and enhance the guest experience. Our journey begins with data, but our destination is the betterment of the hotel's service and profitability.
