# Hotel Data Analysis
This project takes a deep dive into a three-year hotel revenue dataset (2018, 2019, and 2020) using SQL and Power BI. We use SQL queries for data processing, uncovering insights about revenue trends and guest seasonality. Power BI complements this by transforming our findings into visually engaging presentations, enabling us to offer actionable recommendations for staffing arrangements based on the data's nuances. This analysis not only illuminates patterns but also acknowledges dataset limitations, striving to empower businesses in the hospitality industry with informed strategies for success.

# Data Ingestion and Preparation

Our journey begins with the ingestion of raw data from Excel file into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This step ensures that the data is accessible and ready for analysis. Once the data is in SSMS, we embark on the iterative process of building SQL queries, allowing us to refine and shape the dataset to suit our analytical needs. 

# Connection with Data Source
The attached SQL in the repository is used to connect with SQL server and Power BI.

# Effective Data Communication with Power BI
While data analysis is an essential component of our project, effective communication of insights is equally vital. This is where Power BI takes center stage. Leveraging Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions, we create measures to generate visual representations of our findings. Power BI empowers us to produce stunning and interactive data visualizations. To further refine and transform our data, we harness PowerQuery within Power BI, allowing us to construct captivating visual narratives. Through visually engaging charts and graphs, we bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, making even the most intricate data comprehensible to our audience.

# Power BI Dashboard
This is an interactive Power BI Dashboard , you can download it from my repo, it's called " Hotel_Data_Analysis.pbix"

# Summary
This project combines the power of SQL and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. By exploring the hotel's revenue data, we aim to empower businesses to make informed decisions, optimize their operations, and enhance the guest experience. Our journey begins with data, but our destination is the betterment of the hotel's service and profitability.
